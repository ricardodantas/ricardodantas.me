## Hi, I'm Ricardo!  👋

Dad, living in the beautiful city of Stockholm, works as a Software Developer.

I have two main passions: music and technology. I love playing guitar. I also write about technology, life, and a variety of topics that pique my interest.

I don’t follow a strict posting schedule; instead, I prefer to share my thoughts and creations whenever the mood strikes me and the moment feels right. I embrace spontaneity and authenticity in my sharing.

Follow me on [Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@ricardodantas), [BlueSky](https://bsky.app/profile/ricardodantas.me) or [X](https://x.com/ricardodantas).

### 🎸 Music Life

During my “free moments”, I love playing guitar and making music—whether it’s reinterpretations of popular songs or original compositions. I find joy in creating melodies and experimenting with different sounds, although I haven’t released any original tracks publicly yet. You can check out my musical adventures [on my social media](/darkfrets).

### 🧑‍💻 Dev life

Whenever I get the chance, I like to share some of my open-source projects on [my Github profile](https://github.com/ricardodantas). While I may not be posting as many technical articles lately, I still enjoy sharing a few things on the [Dev.to platform](https://dev.to/ricardodantas).
