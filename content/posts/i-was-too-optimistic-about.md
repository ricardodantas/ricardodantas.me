I was initially optimistic about Safari, as it was fast and smooth. However, once I started using extensions, it began to freeze and crash frequently. This was particularly frustrating with the Grammarly extension, which I rely on heavily. Additionally, I experienced crashes on YouTube, and the sound would randomly stop working, forcing me to reload the page. I tried various workarounds, but none of them resolved the issues.

For now, I am switching back to Arc, even though [it will no longer be updated with new features](https://www.theverge.com/news/674603/arc-browser-development-stopped-dia-browser-company). Arc just works, and for web development, it is much better than Safari.
