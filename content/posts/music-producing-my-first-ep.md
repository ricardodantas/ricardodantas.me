I know my [Instagram](https://instagram.com/darkfrets) may look abandoned. I've been quiet there and took a break from posting cover songs. The reason is that I've been working on my first EP, which might include four to five short-length songs. I've always wanted to release my music, but I've postponed this dream for decades, and now it feels like I'm very close to making it a reality.

All the songs are instrumental and designed to tell a story on their own, with sound effects—much different from the metal music I usually write. The songs are finished, and I'm currently in the process of mixing and mastering them. This may take some time, as I can only dedicate a few hours at a time. I'm handling everything myself without outsourcing any part of the work. Because of this, the release of the singles and the EP will be entirely independent, which requires more time. However, it has been an interesting challenge in many ways, and I've been learning a lot about the various aspects of the process.

That's all I can share for now. Hopefully, I will make it through the next months. 🤞
