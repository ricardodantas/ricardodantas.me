For most of my career, I've relied heavily on graphical interfaces. IDEs with countless buttons, browser-based tools, apps with beautiful UIs—the usual stack. But lately, I've been drawn to something different: the terminal.

It started gradually. A few months ago, while [leveling up my dotfiles](/2026/01/23/leveling-up-my-dotfiles/), I realized how much power and flexibility I was leaving on the table by avoiding the command line. Tools like Mise and Fnox showed me that terminal-based workflows could be not only efficient but also more secure and reproducible.

The more I explored, the more I found myself reaching for the terminal instead of clicking through menus. Need to manage files? `ls`, `mv`, `cp`. Search through code? `grep` or `ripgrep`. Git operations? The CLI is faster than any GUI I've used.

There's something satisfying about the directness of it. No waiting for apps to load. No hunting through nested menus. Just type what you want, and it happens. It feels closer to the machine, in a good way.

I'm not abandoning GUIs entirely—that would be impractical. VS Code is still my editor of choice, and some tasks genuinely benefit from visual interfaces. But I'm finding a better balance. The terminal handles the repetitive, scriptable tasks. GUIs handle the visual, exploratory ones.

This shift has also made me appreciate TUI (Text User Interface) applications. They combine the speed of the terminal with just enough visual structure to make complex tasks manageable. Apps like `htop`, `lazygit`, and various file managers have become staples in my workflow.

I've even started building my own TUI tools, but that's a story for another post.

The terminal isn't just a throwback to an earlier era of computing. It's a powerful, modern interface that rewards those who take the time to learn it. And honestly? It's kind of fun to feel like a hacker, even when you're just organizing files.

Let's see where this journey takes me.
