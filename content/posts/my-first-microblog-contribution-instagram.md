This is my first contribution to the Micro.blog community. I’ve created a simple plugin that lets you embed Instagram posts and reels right into your Micro.blog posts.

To install it, just search for Instagram in the plugins directory.

Code available on [Github](https://github.com/ricardodantas/mbplugin-instagram-embedded-posts).
