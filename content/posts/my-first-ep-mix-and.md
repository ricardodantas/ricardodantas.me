I have finally completed the mixing and mastering process! 🎉

In the next couple of weeks, the single will be released, followed by the EP in mid-October.

It was intense and a lot of work, but I managed to do it all by myself. The learning curve was long, and I still have much to learn to improve my workflow. However, I'm happy to say it's finally done!

I spent hours learning about registering songs, entering data for the distribution to streaming platforms, and registering the songs with the [PRO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance_rights_organisation). Now, it’s just a matter of waiting for the distribution process to be completed. Soon, I will reveal the title and links for the streaming platforms.

Overall, it was a very interesting process to learn about composing, mixing, distributing, and releasing music.
