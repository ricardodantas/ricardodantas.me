I began my journey with computers in 1996, using MS Windows. In 1999, I discovered the incredible world of Open Source and Linux, which was mind-blowing.

In 2006, after a trip to the 🇳🇱 Netherlands, I met a guy using a MacBook. I approached him and asked about the computer, and he enthusiastically discussed it. He mentioned that there was an Apple store nearby, which had a wide variety of products on sale. Excited by the opportunity, I decided to buy my very first Apple device—a white MacBook. I had never used macOS before, so I spent the day familiarizing myself with it and customizing the settings to suit my preferences. It was a rewarding experience, and since then, I have exclusively used MacBooks.

The macOS has been a key part of my workflow. For my use case, it is the best Operating System, especially with all the improvements and integration with iPhones and iPads in the last decade.

I have always been concerned about being locked into a single ecosystem, which feels unsettling. Naturally, I have had those thoughts:

> "What if I decide to switch to a different ecosystem someday?"

> "Some apps and workflows that are designed exclusively for Apple devices may have difficulty adjusting to new environments."

Yeah, those points make sense, but in reality, I never switched or truly wished to move away from Apple. In fact, I have only become more invested in their features and devices. Over the years, I have acquired more and more Apple products, and now I own an Apple TV, Apple Watch, iPhone, iPad, MacBook, and Magic Keyboard. However, I do not have the Magic Mouse; in my opinion, it has poor ergonomic design. While its features are impressive, I find it uncomfortable to use for long sessions.

After the recent announcement about unifying features across Apple devices with iOS, macOS, watchOS, and tvOS 26, which will significantly enhance my workflow, I have been considering fully committing to the Apple ecosystem. The overall experience and simplicity of using Apple products are hard to beat. Everything just works, eliminating the need to waste time on configurations. The interface is very intuitive for me, likely because I have been using their devices for decades. If I had to summarize my experience in a single word, it would be "convenience."

For my online services and apps, I have the following setup:

- **iCloud:** Basic plan includes 50GB for syncing app data and hosts my main email with a custom domain.

- **Apple Music:** I recently switched from Spotify because I can't stand the way they treat artists, and their user interface has become very cluttered in recent years. Additionally, I wanted better integration with Apple operating systems, especially to use features like Shortcuts.

- **Apple TV:** I subscribe occasionally. Their catalog is currently limited, especially for kids' content. Because of this, I primarily use Netflix and Disney+ for video streaming.

- **Google Drive:** It's my main cloud storage provider, chosen for easy sharing with non-Apple users.

- **Google Photos:** It's similar to Google Drive, but it's easier to share with non-Apple users.

- **Mail:** I have used Apple Mail for years. I also tried many third-party apps, but due to performance, simplicity, and privacy concerns, I returned to Apple Mail.

- **Notes:** I experimented with various note-taking apps, but ultimately I returned to Apple Notes because accessing my notes across my Apple devices is seamless and straightforward. However, I do miss Markdown, so I use **iA Writer** for creating Markdown content.

- **Reminders:** Just like Apple Notes, this app is seamless and incredibly user-friendly. It's my go-to task management tool!

- **Final Cut:** for video editing. Love it.

- **Logic Pro:** I am currently in a 90-day trial period and not using it yet, but I plan to start soon, especially after the recent updates that include AI integration and improved performance. For music production, I have been using **Luna** from Universal Audio, which I really like. The workflow is very intuitive; however, there are times when it struggles with performance.

- **XCode:** For Apple app development, I am still new to this field, but it is the most integrated IDE for the job. For my regular software development routine, I use **VS Code**. Xcode is not suitable for languages other than Swift and Objective-C, and it lacks many features.

- **Safari:** I switched to Safari for internet browsing because of its performance, bookmark management across devices, which suits my needs for most daily tasks. Previously, I used Arc, but managing numerous pinned tabs became a nightmare, and I frequently experienced performance issues in recent months. However, I still use Arc as a secondary browser for its translation feature, especially when I need to translate languages like Swedish that aren't supported by Apple's translation feature. For front-end related work, I primarily use Arc as well, but I am considering switching to another browser for secondary use.

- **Maps:** I’ve started using Apple Maps more frequently than Google Maps, and I realized it can create lists like Google Maps—this was the missing feature for me. Now, I think it’s finally time to switch completely from Google Maps.

- **Smart home:** I used to use a combination of Google devices, including Google Nest and Google Home, along with the Apple ecosystem. However, I decided to eliminate many of these devices due to compatibility and privacy concerns. Now, I only keep the devices that I truly need and that are Matter-compatible. My plan is to acquire several HomePod Minis to play Apple Music throughout my home.

I plan to completely move away from Google services. Months ago, I began the process of reducing my dependence on Google in my digital life. I dislike their core values, especially regarding privacy. I'm uncertain about the timing and method of this transition, but I will attempt to share updates here.

I understand that none of the major tech companies prioritize privacy, but I try to stick with those that are more committed to delivering privacy-first features.

At the end of the day, it’s not about brand loyalty, it’s about using the tools that help me focus on what matters most: my work, my creativity, and my life with less friction.

I know this setup isn’t perfect, and it might evolve over time. But right now, the Apple ecosystem gives me the balance of performance, simplicity, and integration that I need without constant maintenance or second-guessing.

I’ll keep exploring, refining, and adjusting along the way. If it helps bring a bit more peace and flow into my digital life, then it’s a path worth continuing.
