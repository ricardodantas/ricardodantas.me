I’ve been thinking about starting a blog for a little while now. It’s not about having an audience or building a personal brand. I just want to slow down and share what’s on my mind.

As a software developer and a dad, I understand the challenges of balancing work and family life. I find joy in playing guitar and writing code, and I’m constantly striving to live a more mindful life.

I’m not quite sure yet what this blog will become. Maybe it’ll be a place to share my thoughts on life in Sweden, digital habits, fatherhood, or even the occasional nerdy tech or guitar post. Or maybe it’ll just serve as a public journal.

There is no set schedule for posts; I will write whenever I have time and feel inspired to share something.

Let’s see where this journey takes us.
