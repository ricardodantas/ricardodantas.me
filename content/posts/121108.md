My debut single, Killware, is out now! 🎉

"Killware" began as a fun little idea during a late-night jam session, and before I knew it, it evolved into a more electronic and techno-inspired track. This sparked even more inspiration for the other tracks that will be featured on my first EP, which is set to release on October 15, 2025.  

It's a short instrumental track, just like the others on the upcoming EP, that uses sound effects to tell a story. The EP as a whole is inspired by a cyberpunk theme. So, if you're creating this type of content, it might be helpful for your project.
  
Assembling and releasing everything took a long time, but it was a very rewarding experience. Now I understand the entire process of releasing a song. I’ve taken on the entire process myself, from composing and mixing to mastering and publishing through a distributor.   
  
If you take the time to listen to my music, thank you so much. If you save it to a playlist or share it with a friend, it means the world to an independent artist like me. It genuinely helps me keep going. I’d love to hear what you noticed about my music: a transition you enjoyed, a tone that resonated with you, or even suggestions for improvement. I’m constantly learning and growing with each track I release.
